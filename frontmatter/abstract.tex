Individual development plans are a guideline that employers may use to upskill employees and with the assistance of deep learning techniques, creating these plans may be more personalised to the employee.  This paper presents a deep learning-based IDP Recommender System that could aid in the creation of IDPs using a four model architecture. An IDP typically consists of four components, training courses to attend, career transition potential, development actions and mentorship. For course recommendation we made use of a Two-Stage Hybrid approach that combines Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) scoring with a set-cover optimization, which selects the fewest courses that cover the skill gap. Graph neural networks were used to build the career path prediction model and achieved an NDCG@10 score of 0.849. Development actions are generated using neural collaborative filtering using a 70–20–10 learning framework, reaching an accuracy of 64.7%. Direct matching was used for mentor recommendation. Individual skill information was used to identify suitable mentors resulting in an accuracy of 76.4%. The models were trained on several datasets covering courses, job information, career paths and employee profiles. This paper has four key contributions. First, it looks at course recommendation as a coverage optimisation problem rather than a standard link-prediction problem. Secondly, it evaluates and compares GNN, neural collaborative filtering, and transformer-based models for career path prediction. Finally, it presents a system capable of generating personalised individual development plans.  All four models were integrated to provide full IDP suggestions.

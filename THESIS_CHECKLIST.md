# Thesis checklist

## Purpose
- Single-source checklist for the current state of the thesis repository (integration, bibliography, layout). Use this to track remaining fixes and verify build steps.

## Quick plan
- Keep using BibTeX (per user instruction).
- Finish remaining layout fixes (overfull/underfull boxes, table overflows).
- Finalize a full XeLaTeX build and inspect resulting PDF.

## Checklist (items, current status)

1) Bibliography
- [x] Ensure citation commands in chapter-2 use `\cite{}` instead of `\parencite{}`. (Done)
- [x] Fix malformed `.bib` author fields (comma lists → `and`, uppercase `AND` → `and`). (Done)
- [x] Convert nonstandard entry types for BibTeX (example: `@dataset` → `@misc`). (Done for `david_cortes_7351542e`)
- [x] Run xelatex → bibtex → xelatex ×2 and produce `main.bbl`. (Done)

2) Citation verification
- [x] Verify that all citation keys used in chapter-2 appear in the `.bib` databases. (USED_COUNT=119, BIB_COUNT=180, MISSING_COUNT=0)
- [ ] Scan all chapters for undefined citation keys (if you want, I can run this across the whole document). (Pending, can run on request)

3) Layout and typography
- [x] Apply initial fixes to tables in `mainmatter/chapter-2-literature-review.tex` to reduce page overflows. (Partial: many changes applied)
- [ ] Resolve remaining overfull/underfull \hbox warnings reported by XeLaTeX (examples found; largest: Overfull \hbox 30.4pt). (Actionable)
- [ ] Reflow or convert wide tables to `tabularx`/`adjustbox`/scale them where needed to prevent page overflow. (Actionable)

4) Final typeset and checks
- [ ] Produce final PDF and visually inspect all chapters (especially tables and long equations). (Actionable)
- [ ] Run a quick lint: search for remaining ``TODO`` markers and check for unreferenced figures/tables. (Optional)

5) Optional / future
- [ ] If you want biblatex full features, install `biber` and switch `layout/tudelft-report.cls` back to `backend=biber` (needs biber on PATH). (Deferred)

## How to reproduce the current build (PowerShell)

```powershell
# from repo root (Windows PowerShell)
xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error main.tex
bibtex main
xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error main.tex
xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error main.tex
```

## Notes and next actions I can take now (pick one)
- A) Auto-fix the largest overfull box(es): I will edit the offending paragraph/table (use `tabularx` or local `\sloppy`) and re-run XeLaTeX to confirm. (fast)
- B) Produce a short report listing each overfull/underfull message with file and line range and suggested edits so you can approve changes. (safer)
- C) Run a repo-wide citation-key check for all chapters. (quick)

## Requirements coverage (mapping)
- Use BibTeX backend: Done (class set to backend=bibtex).
- Make `\cite{}` work in chapter-2: Done.
- Fix overflowing tables: Partial — initial fixes applied; further targeted fixes remain.
- Make bibliography render to PDF: In progress — `main.bbl` generated; final PDF generation + visual check pending.

If you want me to proceed, tell me which next action (A, B or C). If you prefer edits to be minimal/visible, choose B; for quick fixes choose A.

abstract = {Objectives
Data extraction from original study reports is a time-consuming, error-prone process in systematic review development. Information extraction (IE) systems have the potential to assist humans in the extraction task, however majority of IE systems were not designed to work on Portable Document Format (PDF) document, an important and common extraction source for systematic review. In a PDF document, narrative content is often mixed with publication metadata or semi-structured text, which add challenges to the underlining natural language processing algorithm. Our goal is to categorize PDF texts for strategic use by IE systems.
Methods
We used an open-source tool to extract raw texts from a PDF document and developed a text classification algorithm that follows a multi-pass sieve framework to automatically classify PDF text snippets (for brevity, texts) into TITLE, ABSTRACT, BODYTEXT, SEMISTRUCTURE, and METADATA categories. To validate the algorithm, we developed a gold standard of PDF reports that were included in the development of previous systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration. In a two-step procedure, we evaluated (1) classification performance, and compared it with machine learning classifier, and (2) the effects of the algorithm on an IE system that extracts clinical outcome mentions.
Results
The multi-pass sieve algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6%, which was 9.7% (p<0.001) higher than the best performing machine learning classifier that used a logistic regression algorithm. F-measure improvements were observed in the classification of TITLE (+15.6%), ABSTRACT (+54.2%), BODYTEXT (+3.7%), SEMISTRUCTURE (+34%), and MEDADATA (+14.2%). In addition, use of the algorithm to filter semi-structured texts and publication metadata improved performance of the outcome extraction system (F-measure +4.1%, p=0.002). It also reduced of number of sentences to be processed by 44.9% (p<0.001), which corresponds to a processing time reduction of 50% (p=0.005).
Conclusions
The rule-based multi-pass sieve framework can be used effectively in categorizing texts extracted from PDF documents. Text classification is an important prerequisite step to leverage information extraction from PDF documents.}

  title = {Personalized Employee Training Course Recommendation with Career Development Awareness},
  abstract = {As a major component of strategic talent management, learning and development (L\&D) aims at improving the individual and organization performances through planning tailored training for employees to increase and improve their skills and knowledge. While many companies have developed the learning management systems (LMSs) for facilitating the online training of employees, a long-standing important issue is how to achieve personalized training recommendations with the consideration of their needs for future career development. To this end, in this paper, we propose an explainable personalized online course recommender system for enhancing employee training and development. A unique perspective of our system is to jointly model both the employees’ current competencies and their career development preferences in an explainable way. Specifically, the recommender system is based on a novel end-to-end hierarchical framework, namely Demand-aware Collaborative Bayesian Variational Network (DCBVN). In DCBVN, we first extract the latent interpretable representations of the employees’ competencies from their skill profiles with autoencoding variational inference based topic modeling. Then, we develop an effective demand recognition mechanism for learning the personal demands of career development for employees. In particular, all the above processes are integrated into a unified Bayesian inference view for obtaining both accurate and explainable recommendations. Finally, extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and the interpretability of DCBVN, as well as its robustness on sparse and cold-start scenarios.},

  title = {Artificial Intelligence Models and Employee Lifecycle Management: A Systematic Literature Review},
  abstract = {Abstract Background and purpose: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) models for data-driven decision-making in different stages of employee lifecycle (EL) management is increasing. However, there is no comprehensive study that addresses contributions of AI in EL management. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to address this theoretical gap and determine the contribution of AI models to EL management. Methods: This study applied the PRISMA method, a systematic literature review model, to ensure that the maximum number of publications related to the subject can be accessed. The output of the PRISMA model led to the identification of 23 related articles, and the findings of this study were presented based on the analysis of these articles. Results: The findings revealed that AI algorithms were used in all stages of EL management (i.e., recruitment, on-boarding, employability and benefits, retention, and off-boarding). It was also disclosed that Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network algorithms outperform other algorithms and were the most used in the literature. Conclusion: Although the use of AI models in solving EL management problems is increasing, research on this topic is still in its infancy stage, and more research on this topic is necessary.},

  abstract = {Introduction Mentoring is crucial to the success of STEM higher education. The Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a common career development tool in STEM graduate education that facilitates structured mentor-mentee interactions and goal setting. This study examined the integration of AI mentors into the myIDP framework to provide real-time support and career insights. Methods Using Google Gemini as an AI mentor, this study developed and assessed AI prompts within the myIDP framework. Eighteen STEM graduate students, primarily from underrepresented groups, were trained to engage with the AI mentor. Their interactions, feedback, and comments were analyzed using sentiment and thematic analysis. Results Participants reported positive experiences with AI mentors, noting benefits, such as immediate responses, up-to-date information, access to multiple AI mentors, enhanced ownership of career development, and time savings. However, concerns about misinformation, bias, privacy, equity, and algorithmic influences have also been raised. The study identified two hybrid human-AI mentoring models—Sequential Integration and Concurrent Collaboration—that combine the unique strengths of human and AI mentors to enhance the mentoring process. Discussion This study underscores the potential of AI mentors to enhance IDP practices by providing timely feedback and career information, thereby empowering students in their STEM career development. The proposed human-AI mentoring models show promise in supporting underrepresented minorities, potentially broadening participation in STEM fields.},

  title = {How talent management execution impacts career experiences: exploring the organization-individual intersect},
  abstract = {The aim of the research was to investigate the ways in which talent management execution impacts the individual career experiences of talent, specifically exploring how talent management execution and career enablement can be closer aligned to unlock value for both the organization and the individual. A qualitative research design was employed to explore the research question. During the first phase of the research data was collected from 13 talent management professionals using purposeful sampling and semi-structured interviews. During the second phase of the research the Delphi method was used to validate the findings ( n = 8). Four broad themes were identified as the most prominent ways in which talent management execution impacts the career experiences of individuals. The first is the philosophical underpinning that the organization holds in how talent is defined as well as the exclusivity or inclusivity of their approach. The second is the identification criteria used to identify talent within the organization. Thirdly, the extent to which talent management practices are aligned with career enablement practices and the congruence between these. Lastly, the role of the psychological contract and employee experience in managing mutual expectations. The resultant tension must be proactively managed by (1) clearly articulating the talent philosophy and making this visible through talent management execution, (2) ensuring alignment between talent management practices and the career enablement available to talent, and (3) delivering on expectations through the lived experiences of talent. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on talent management and careers, with a specific focus on the intersection between these and defining ways to align these practices to create congruent and authentic career experiences for individuals.},

  abstract = {To explore how personal development can be utilized as a tool for leaders to adapt to our VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world, a qualitative study was conducted on the narrative experiences of eight leaders who had successfully completed personal development plans. The emerging field of vertical leadership development, recognized as a unique developmental approach towards overcoming complexity and uncertainty, was connected to the key themes of personal development planning. Vertical leadership development and personal development planning were united across five conceptual themes: development and application of skills, self-awareness, self-efficacy, self-exploration, and continuous improvement. The experiences of the participants helped to inform how their plans connected with these themes, and how plan success and retention can be ensured overall. The study found that plans are at their most successful when they are thoroughly structured with the individual’s personal goals in mind, have direct application to the participant’s working life, and are supported by some degree of accountability and/or reflection. The study observed thematic connections between conventional personal development plans and vertical leadership development, highlighting potential connections between developmental approaches that are focused on boosting skills competency and capacity in times of VUCA. The findings help to inform how personal development plans can best serve as a resource towards managing complexity, uncertainty, and change.},

  abstract = {Abstract Introduction: Early-stage clinical and translational researchers who set and track career goals, milestones, and progress are successful in career development. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the Customized Career Development Platform (CCDP), an online individual development plan (IDP), versus the traditional IDP template in improving research success and career satisfaction. Methods: We conducted a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial of 340 scholars and trainees at 27 US academic healthcare institutions. The primary outcome was number of published manuscripts 24 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included the number of grant proposals submitted and funded, job satisfaction, and level of communication with mentors. An analysis of CCDP participants assessed proficiency level for the 14 Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) competencies. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat. Results: Participants were mostly female (60.3\%) and Caucasian (67.2\%); mean age was 34 years. Twenty-four months following the intervention, the CCDP versus traditional IDP groups showed a similar number of publications (9.4 vs 8.6), grants submitted (4.1 vs 4.4) and funded (1.3 vs 2.0), and job satisfaction score (3.6 vs 3.7). The CCDP group had higher odds of discussing communication (OR = 2.08) and leadership skills (OR = 2.62) and broadening their network (2.31) than the traditional IDP group. The CCDP arm reported improvements in 9 of the 14 CTSA competencies. Conclusion: The CCDP offers CTSA hubs an innovative alternative to traditional IDP tools. Future studies are needed to elucidate why the CCDP users did not fully appreciate or adopt the functionality of the online platform.},

  abstract = {Globally, organizations invest an estimated USD 60 billion annually in leadership development; however, the workplace application of learning is typically low, and many programs underperform or fail, resulting in wasted time and money and potential harm. This article presents a novel theory- and evidence-informed framework to maximize the outcomes and return on investment (ROI) of leadership development programs. The foundation of the framework derives from four separate literature reviews: three systematic reviews on leadership development, including the only two to isolate gold-standard elements of effective design, delivery, and evaluation, and one on “training transfer”. Informed by innovative principles of leadership development and unique theoretical models and frameworks, this framework consists of 65 evidence-informed strategies that can be applied as a foundation (9), and before (23), during (17), at the conclusion of (11), and sometime after (5), programs, to maximize impact and ROI. Implications for practice and further research are also presented. Given the stakes, there is an urgent need for evidence and tools to maximize the impact and ROI of leadership development. This novel framework provides robust theory- and evidence-informed guidance for governments, policymakers, and those funding, designing, delivering, and supporting development.},

  title = {The Impact of Leadership Development Programs on Organizational Resilience and Change Management},
  abstract = {Modern business environments require organizations to possess advanced tools which Leadership Development Programs (LDPs) develop through their pivotal role in this process. This research examines how Leadership Development Programs (LDPs) support the development of organizational resilience as well as strengthen change management capabilities. An organization needs resilience to respond to disruptions and requires effective change management for achieving smooth transitions during times of essential transformation. Organizational performance metrics have been assessed using a mixed methods model which combines quantitative survey data with qualitative data analysis for evaluating LDP impact. Leadership development programs that follow well-defined structures produce remarkable improvements in leaders' ability to predict future crises as well as their management and adaptation skills. Within organizations LDPs set the stage for adaptable workplaces through which innovation can thrive because team members experience less resistance during transitions. Industrial case studies prove that companies which implement leadership development efforts achieve swift returns through operational efficiency while retaining workforce commitment and maintaining market superiority. Multiple barriers exist in the way of LDP program success including resource limitations and goal misalignment and inconsistent program assessment approaches. To achieve maximal results from LDPs organizations must develop specific leadership development programs that include all stakeholders and connect directly to organizational goals. This research adds value to established literature through its combination of resilience theory with change management theory as precise foundations for leadership development models. This work presents practical guidance to professionals by outlining step-by-step solutions for designing LDPs together with methods to enhance organizational adaptiveness and valid assessment metrics. Organizations must establish leadership development as their strategic base for sustainable growth since changes and uncertainties demand immediate attention},

  abstract = {Abstract Recommender systems are efficient tools for filtering online information, which is widespread owing to the changing habits of computer users, personalization trends, and emerging access to the internet. Even though the recent recommender systems are eminent in giving precise recommendations, they suffer from various limitations and challenges like scalability, cold-start, sparsity, etc. Due to the existence of various techniques, the selection of techniques becomes a complex work while building application-focused recommender systems. In addition, each technique comes with its own set of features, advantages and disadvantages which raises even more questions, which should be addressed. This paper aims to undergo a systematic review on various recent contributions in the domain of recommender systems, focusing on diverse applications like books, movies, products, etc. Initially, the various applications of each recommender system are analysed. Then, the algorithmic analysis on various recommender systems is performed and a taxonomy is framed that accounts for various components required for developing an effective recommender system. In addition, the datasets gathered, simulation platform, and performance metrics focused on each contribution are evaluated and noted. Finally, this review provides a much-needed overview of the current state of research in this field and points out the existing gaps and challenges to help posterity in developing an efficient recommender system.},

  title = {Accuracy Improvements for Cold-Start Recommendation Problem using Indirect Relations in Social Networks},
  abstract = {Abstract Recent advances on Internet applications have facilitated information spreading. Thanks to a wide variety of mobile devices and the burgeoning 5G networks, users gain access easily and quickly to information. Also, the great amount of digital information has contributed to the emergence of recommender systems that help information filtering. As the rise of mobile networks has pushed forward the growth of social media networks, users have gotten used to posting whatever they do and wherever they visit on the Web. Nevertheless, quick social media updates can make it difficult for users to find historical data. For this reason, this paper presents a social network-based recommender system. Our purpose is to build a user-centered recommender system to exclude the products that users are disinterested in according to user preferences and their friends' shopping experiences so as to make recommendations effective. There is normally no corresponding reference value for new products or services, so we use the indirect relations between friends and "friends’ friends" as well as sentinel friends to improve the recommendation accuracy. Our proposed mechanism has been proven efficient in enhancing recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract = {<ns4:p><ns4:bold>Background</ns4:bold>: The demand for online education promotion platforms has increased. In addition, the digital library system is one of the many systems that support teaching and learning. However, most digital library systems store books in the form of libraries that were developed or purchased exclusively by the library, without connecting data with different agencies in the same system.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Methods</ns4:bold>: A hybrid recommender system model for digital libraries, developed from multiple online publishers, has created a prototype digital library system that connects various important knowledge sources from multiple digital libraries and online publishers to create an index and recommend e-books. The developed system utilizes an API-based linking process to connect various important sources of knowledge from multiple data sources such as e-books on education from educational institutions, e-books from government agencies, and e-books from religious organizations are stored separately. Then, a hybrid recommender system suitable for users was developed using Collaborative Filtering (CF) model together with Content-Based Filtering. This research purposed the hybrid recommender system model, which took into account the factors of book category, reading habits of users, and sources of information. The evaluation of the experiments involved soliciting feedback from system users and comparing the results with conventional recommendation methods.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Results</ns4:bold>: A comparison of NDCG scores was conducted for Hybrid Score 50:50, Hybrid Score 20:80, Hybrid Score 80:20, CF-score and CB-score.

  title = {Hesitation and Tolerance in Recommender Systems},
  abstract = {User interactions in recommender systems are inherently complex, often involving behaviors that go beyond simple acceptance or rejection. One particularly common behavior is hesitation, where users deliberate over recommended items, signaling uncertainty. Our large-scale surveys, with 6,644 and 3,864 responses respectively, confirm that hesitation is not only widespread but also has a profound impact on user experiences. When users spend additional time engaging with content they are ultimately uninterested in, this can lead to negative emotions, a phenomenon we term as tolerance. The surveys reveal that such tolerance behaviors often arise after hesitation and can erode trust, satisfaction, and long-term loyalty to the platform. For instance, a click might reflect a need for more information rather than genuine interest, and prolonged exposure to unsuitable content amplifies frustration. This misalignment between user intent and system interpretation introduces noise into recommendation training, resulting in suggestions that increase uncertainty and disengagement. To address these issues, we identified signals indicative of tolerance behavior and analyzed datasets from both e-commerce and short-video platforms. The analysis shows a strong correlation between increased tolerance behavior and decreased user activity. We integrated these insights into the training process of a recommender system for a major short-video platform. Results from four independent online A/B experiments demonstrated significant improvements in user retention, achieved with minimal additional computational costs. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing hesitation as a ubiquitous user behavior and addressing tolerance to enhance satisfaction, build trust, and sustain long-term engagement in recommender systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Educational recommender systems offer benefits for workplace learning by tailoring the selection of learning activities to the individual’s learning goals. However, existing systems focus on the learner as the primary stakeholder of learning processes and do not consider the organization’s perspective. We conducted a systematic review to develop a categorization of workplace learning goals for multi-stakeholder recommender systems. Out of an initial set of 13,198 publications exported from databases, a final sample of 34 key publications was identified, according to predefined inclusion criteria. Content analysis and reflective exchange were deployed to synthesize workplace learning goals investigated in the key publications. We identified five categories of workplace learning goals that can be arranged along a dimension from intrinsic (goals set exclusively by the learner) to external (goals set exclusively by the organization). Our categorization provides a common language for multi-stakeholder recommender systems incorporating both the learner’s and the organization’s perspectives.},

  abstract = {Abstract Academic advising is inhibited at most of the high schools to help students identify appropriate academic pathways. The choice of a career domain is significantly influenced by the complexity of life and the volatility of the labor market. Thus, high school students feel confused during the shift period from high school to university, especially with the enormous amounts of data available on the Web. In this paper, an extensive comparative study is conducted to investigate five approaches of recommender systems for university study field and career domain guidance. A novel ontology is constructed to include all the needed information for this purpose. The developed approaches considered user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, demographic-based recommendation, knowledge base supported by case-based reasoning, ontology, as well as different hybridizations of them. A case study on Lebanese high school students is analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented approaches. The experimental results indicate that the knowledge-based hybrid recommender system, combined with the user-based collaborative filtering and braced with case-based reasoning as well as ontology, generated 98\% of similar cases, 95\% of them are personalized based on the interests of the high school students. The average usefulness feedback and satisfaction level of the students concerning this proposed hybrid approach reached 95\% and 92.5\% respectively, which could be a solution to similar problems, regardless of the application domain. Besides, the constructed ontology could be reused in other systems in the educational domain.},

The magnitude of individual gains from personalized content increases with the amount of data available about a student and with preferences for niche content: heavy users with long histories of content interactions who prefer niche content benefit more than infrequent, newer users who like popular content.

  title = {A deep learning based hybrid recommendation model for internet users},
  abstract = {Abstract Recommendation Systems (RS) play a crucial role in delivering personalized item suggestions, yet traditional methods often struggle with accuracy, scalability, efficiency, and cold-start challenges. This paper presents the HRS-IU-DL model, a novel hybrid recommendation system that advances the field by integrating multiple sophisticated techniques to enhance both accuracy and relevance. The proposed model uniquely combines user-based and item-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) to effectively analyze user-item interactions, Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) to capture complex non-linear relationships, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to identify sequential patterns in user behavior. Furthermore, it incorporates Content-Based Filtering (CBF) with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for in-depth analysis of item attributes. A key contribution of this work is the innovative fusion of CF, NCF, RNN, and CBF, which collectively address significant challenges such as data sparsity, the cold-start problem, and the increasing demand for personalized recommendations. Additionally, the model employs N-Sample techniques to recommend the top 10 similar items based on user-specified genres, leveraging methods like Cosine Similarity, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and TF-IDF. The HRS-IU-DL model is rigorously evaluated on the publicly available Movielens 100k dataset using train-test splits. Performance is assessed using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Precision, and Recall. The results demonstrate that the HRS-IU-DL model not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches but also achieves substantial improvements across these evaluation metrics, highlighting its contribution to the advancement of RS technology.},

This study employs text-mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to examine these approaches in building control and occupant interaction. Analyzing approximately 27,000 articles from the ScienceDirect database, we found extensive use of recommendation systems and reinforcement learning for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Despite broad applications, their use in optimizing indoor environments and energy efficiency is limited. Traditional recommendation algorithms are commonly used, but optimizing indoor conditions and energy efficiency often requires advanced machine learning techniques like reinforcement and deep learning. This review highlights the potential for expanding recommender systems and reinforcement learning applications in buildings and indoor environments. Areas for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendations, and optimizing environments for specific needs like sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback.},

  abstract = {Recommender systems are powerful systems that give added value to business and corporation. They are relatively recent technology and they will only keep improving in the future. The most widely used algorithms for recommender systems are categorized into the traditional recommender and deep-based recommender system. The traditional recommendation algorithm suffers from sparse data that significantly degrades recommendation accuracy. The hybrid approaches are attempts to tackle recommendation challenges. This paper addresses the integration of deep learning into traditional recommendation approaches especially, Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms to get a significant accurate prediction. It proposes a hybrid deep CF recommender model called ConvSVD++ that tightly integrates Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD++). The proposed model incorporates items' content, implicit user's feedback along with explicit item-user interaction to enhance prediction accuracy and handle sparsity problem. The proposed model is evaluated and all baseline models based on Movielens- 1M datasets. The results are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric and it is concluded that the proposed model ConvSVD++ outperforms the baselines models. Accordingly, it is concluded that integrating CNN with SVD++ algorithm improves rating prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {Recommendation is very crucial technique for social networking sites and business organizations. It provides suggestions based on users’ personalized interest and provide users with movies, books and topics links that would be most suitable for them. It can improve user effectiveness and business revenue by approximately 30\%, if analyzed in intelligent manner. Social recommendation systems for traditional datasets are already analyzed by researchers and practitioners in detail. Several researchers have improved recommendation accuracy and throughput by using various innovative approaches. Deep learning has been proven to provide significant improvements in image processing and object recognition. It is machine learning technique where hidden layers are used to improve outcome. In traditional recommendation techniques, sparsity and cold start are limitations which are due to less user-item interactions. This can be removed by using deep learning models which can improve user-item matrix entries by using feature learning. In this paper, various models are explained with their applications. Readers can identify best suitable model from these deep learning models for recommendation based on their needs and incorporate in their techniques. When these recommendation systems are deployed on large scale of data, accuracy degrades significantly. Social big graph is most suitable for large scale social data. Further improvements for recommendations are explained with the use of large scale graph partitioning. MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) are used as evaluation parameters which are used to prove better recommendation accuracy. Epinions, MovieLens and FilmTrust datasets are also shown as most commonly used datasets for recommendation purpose.},

  title = {An academic recommender system on large citation data based on clustering, graph modeling and deep learning},
  abstract = {Abstract Recommendation (recommender) systems (RS) have played a significant role in both research and industry in recent years. In the area of academia, there is a need to help researchers discover the most appropriate and relevant scientific information through recommendations. Nevertheless, we argue that there is a major gap between academic state-of-the-art RS and real-world problems. In this paper, we present a novel multi-staged RS based on clustering, graph modeling and deep learning that manages to run on a full dataset (scientific digital library) in the magnitude of millions users and items (papers). We run several tests (experiments/evaluation) as a means to find the best approach regarding the tuning of our system; so, we present and compare three versions of our RS regarding recall and NDCG metrics. The results show that a multi-staged RS that utilizes a variety of techniques and algorithms is able to face real-world problems and large academic datasets. In this way, we suggest a way to close or minimize the gap between research and industry value RS.},

  title = {When Newer is Not Better: Does Deep Learning Really Benefit Recommendation From Implicit Feedback?},
  abstract = {In recent years, neural models have been repeatedly touted to exhibit state-of-the-art performance in recommendation. Nevertheless, multiple recent studies have revealed that the reported state-of-the-art results of many neural recommendation models cannot be reliably replicated. A primary reason is that existing evaluations are performed under various inconsistent protocols. Correspondingly, these replicability issues make it difficult to understand how much benefit we can actually gain from these neural models. It then becomes clear that a fair and comprehensive performance comparison between traditional and neural models is needed. Motivated by these issues, we perform a large-scale, systematic study to compare recent neural recommendation models against traditional ones in top-n recommendation from implicit data. We propose a set of evaluation strategies for measuring memorization performance, generalization performance, and subgroup-specific performance of recommendation models. We conduct extensive experiments with 13 popular recommendation models (including two neural models and 11 traditional ones as baselines) on nine commonly used datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that even with extensive hyper-parameter searches, neural models do not dominate traditional models in all aspects, e.g., they fare worse in terms of average HitRate. We further find that there are areas where neural models seem to outperform non-neural models, for example, in recommendation diversity and robustness between different subgroups of users and items. Our work illuminates the relative advantages and disadvantages of neural models in recommendation and is therefore an important step towards building better recommender systems.},

  title = {Deep learning for recommender systems: A Netflix case study},
  abstract = {Abstract Deep learning has profoundly impacted many areas of machine learning. However, it took a while for its impact to be felt in the field of recommender systems. In this article, we outline some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in using deep learning for recommender systems at Netflix. We first provide an overview of the various recommendation tasks on the Netflix service. We found that different model architectures excel at different tasks. Even though many deep‐learning models can be understood as extensions of existing (simple) recommendation algorithms, we initially did not observe significant improvements in performance over well‐tuned non‐deep‐learning approaches. Only when we added numerous features of heterogeneous types to the input data, deep‐learning models did start to shine in our setting. We also observed that deep‐learning methods can exacerbate the problem of offline–online metric (mis‐)alignment. After addressing these challenges, deep learning has ultimately resulted in large improvements to our recommendations as measured by both offline and online metrics. On the practical side, integrating deep‐learning toolboxes in our system has made it faster and easier to implement and experiment with both deep‐learning and non‐deep‐learning approaches for various recommendation tasks. We conclude this article by summarizing our take‐aways that may generalize to other applications beyond Netflix.},

  abstract = {Sequential models that encode user activity for next action prediction have become a popular design choice for building web-scale personalized recommendation systems. Traditional methods of sequential recommendation either utilize end-to-end learning on realtime user actions, or learn user representations separately in an offline batch-generated manner. This paper (1) presents Pinterest's ranking architecture for Homefeed, our personalized recommendation product and the largest engagement surface; (2) proposes TransAct, a sequential model that extracts users' short-term preferences from their realtime activities; (3) describes our hybrid approach to ranking, which combines end-to-end sequential modeling via TransAct with batch-generated user embeddings. The hybrid approach allows us to combine the advantages of responsiveness from learning directly on realtime user activity with the cost-effectiveness of batch user representations learned over a longer time period. We describe the results of ablation studies, the challenges we faced during productionization, and the outcome of an online A/B experiment, which validates the effectiveness of our hybrid ranking model. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of TransAct on other surfaces such as contextual recommendations and search. Our model has been deployed to production in Homefeed, Related Pins, Notifications, and Search at Pinterest.},

  Systems: A Comprehensive Survey},
  abstract = {This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of big data algorithms in recommendation systems, addressing the lack of depth and precision in existing literature. It proposes a two-pronged approach: a thorough analysis of current algorithms and a novel, hierarchical taxonomy for precise categorization. The taxonomy is based on a tri-level hierarchy, starting with the methodology category and narrowing down to specific techniques. Such a framework allows for a structured and comprehensive classification of algorithms, assisting researchers in understanding the interrelationships among diverse algorithms and techniques. Covering a wide range of algorithms, this taxonomy first categorizes algorithms into four main analysis types: User and Item Similarity-Based Methods, Hybrid and Combined Approaches, Deep Learning and Algorithmic Methods, and Mathematical Modeling Methods, with further subdivisions into sub-categories and techniques. The paper incorporates both empirical and experimental evaluations to differentiate between the techniques. The empirical evaluation ranks the techniques based on four criteria. The experimental assessments rank the algorithms that belong to the same category, sub-category, technique, and sub-technique. Also, the paper illuminates the future prospects of big data techniques in recommendation systems, underscoring potential advancements and opportunities for further research in this field},

Thy are computationally intensive and often become a major bottleneck, due to the increasing performance gap between the CPUs used for preprocessing and the GPUs used for model training. Recent studies show that a significant number of CPUs across several machines are required to achieve sufficient throughput to saturate the GPUs, leading to increased resource and energy consumption. When the pipeline involves vocabulary generation, the preprocessing performance scales poorly due to significant row-wise synchronization overhead between different CPU cores and servers. To address this limitation, in this paper we present the design of Piper, a hardware accelerator for tabular data preprocessing, prototype it on FPGAs, and demonstrate its potential for training pipelines of commercial recommender systems. Piper achieves 4.7 \$\textbackslash{}sim\$ 71.3\$\textbackslash{}times\$ speedup in latency over a 128-core CPU server and outperforms a data-center GPU by 4.8\$\textbackslash{}sim\$ 20.3\$\textbackslash{}times\$ when using binary input.

  abstract = {By providing personalized suggestions to users, recommender systems have become essential to numerous online platforms. Collaborative filtering, particularly graph-based approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have demonstrated great results in terms of recommendation accuracy. However, accuracy may not always be the most important criterion for evaluating recommender systems' performance, since beyond-accuracy aspects such as recommendation diversity, serendipity, and fairness can strongly influence user engagement and satisfaction. This review paper focuses on addressing these dimensions in GNN-based recommender systems, going beyond the conventional accuracy-centric perspective. We begin by reviewing recent developments in approaches that improve not only the accuracy-diversity trade-off but also promote serendipity, and fairness in GNN-based recommender systems. We discuss different stages of model development including data preprocessing, graph construction, embedding initialization, propagation layers, embedding fusion, score computation, and training methodologies. Furthermore, we present a look into the practical difficulties encountered in assuring diversity, serendipity, and fairness, while retaining high accuracy. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for developing more robust GNN-based recommender systems that go beyond the unidimensional perspective of focusing solely on accuracy. This review aims to provide researchers and practitioners with an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted issues that arise when designing GNN-based recommender systems, setting our work apart by offering a comprehensive exploration of beyond-accuracy dimensions.},

  title = {A Survey on Diffusion Models for Recommender Systems},
  abstract = {While traditional recommendation techniques have made significant strides in the past decades, they still suffer from limited generalization performance caused by factors like inadequate collaborative signals, weak latent representations, and noisy data. In response, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising solutions for recommender systems due to their robust generative capabilities, solid theoretical foundations, and improved training stability. To this end, in this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey on diffusion models for recommendation, and draw a bird's-eye view from the perspective of the whole pipeline in real-world recommender systems. We systematically categorize existing research works into three primary domains: (1) diffusion for data engineering \& encoding, focusing on data augmentation and representation enhancement; (2) diffusion as recommender models, employing diffusion models to directly estimate user preferences and rank items; and (3) diffusion for content presentation, utilizing diffusion models to generate personalized content such as fashion and advertisement creatives. Our taxonomy highlights the unique strengths of diffusion models in capturing complex data distributions and generating high-quality, diverse samples that closely align with user preferences. We also summarize the core characteristics of the adapting diffusion models for recommendation, and further identify key areas for future exploration, which helps establish a roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance recommender systems through the innovative application of diffusion models. To further facilitate the research community of recommender systems based on diffusion models, we actively maintain a GitHub repository for papers and other related resources in this rising direction https://github.com/CHIANGEL/Awesome-Diffusion-for-RecSys.},

We discuss * Similarity Metrics: to quantify the precision of content-based filtering mechanisms and assess the accuracy of collaborative filtering techniques. * Candidate Generation Metrics: to evaluate how effectively the system identifies a broad yet relevant range of items. * Predictive Metrics: to assess the accuracy of forecasted user preferences. * Ranking Metrics: to evaluate the effectiveness of the order in which recommendations are presented. * Business Metrics: to align the performance of the recommendation system with economic objectives. Our approach emphasizes the contextual application of these metrics and their interdependencies. In this paper, we identify the strengths and limitations of current evaluation practices and highlight the nuanced trade-offs that emerge when optimizing recommendation systems across different metrics. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for selecting and interpreting these metrics to not only improve system performance but also to advance business goals. This work is to aid researchers and practitioners in critically assessing recommendation systems and fosters the development of more nuanced, effective, and economically viable personalization strategies.

  abstract = {The type of information systems used to recommend items to the users are called Recommendation systems.The concept of recommendations was seen among cavemen, ants and other creatures too.Users often rely on opinion of their peers when looking for selecting something, this usual behavior of the humans, led to the development of recommendation systems.There exist various recommender systems for various areas.The existing recommendation systems use different approaches.The applications of recommendation systems are increasing with increased use of web based search for users' specific requirements.Recommendation techniques are employed by general purpose websites such as google and yahoo based on browsing history and other information like user's geographical locations, interests, behavior in the web, history of purchase and the way they entered the website.Document recommendation systems recommend documents depending on the similar search done previously by other users.Clickstream data which provides information like user behavior and the path the users take are captured and given as input to document recommendation system.Movie recommendation systems and music recommendation systems are other areas in use and being researched to improve.Social recommendation is gaining the momentum because of huge volume of data generated and diverse requirements of the users.Current web usage trends are forcing companies to continuously research for best ways to provide the users with the suitable information as per the need depending on the search and preferences.This paper throws light on common strategies being followed for building recommendation systems.The study compares existing techniques and highlights the opportunities available for research in this area.},

  title = {Integrating contextual sentiment analysis in collaborative recommender systems},
  abstract = {Recently. recommender systems have become a very crucial application in the online market and e-commerce as users are often astounded by choices and preferences and they need help finding what the best they are looking for. Recommender systems have proven to overcome information overload issues in the retrieval of information, but still suffer from persistent problems related to cold-start and data sparsity. On the flip side, sentiment analysis technique has been known in translating text and expressing user preferences. It is often used to help online businesses to observe customers' feedbacks on their products as well as try to understand customer needs and preferences. However, the current solution for embedding traditional sentiment analysis in recommender solutions seems to have limitations when involving multiple domains. Therefore, an issue called domain sensitivity should be addressed. In this paper, a sentiment-based model with contextual information for recommender system was proposed. A novel solution for domain sensitivity was proposed by applying a contextual information sentiment-based model for recommender systems. In evaluating the contributions of contextual information in sentiment-based recommendations, experiments were divided into standard rating model, standard sentiment model and contextual information model. Results showed that the proposed contextual information sentiment-based model illustrates better performance as compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach.},

  title = {A Survey of Accuracy Evaluation Metrics of Recommendation Tasks},
  abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many algorithms have been suggested for providing recommendations. These algorithms typically perform differently in various domains and tasks. Therefore, it is important from the research perspective, as well as from a practical view, to be able to decide on an algorithm that matches the domain and the task of interest. The standard way to make such decisions is by comparing a number of algorithms offline using some evaluation metric. Indeed, many evaluation metrics have been suggested for comparing recommendation algorithms. The decision on the proper evaluation metric is often critical, as each metric may favor a different algorithm. In this paper we review the proper construction of offline experiments for deciding on the most appropriate algorithm. We discuss three important tasks of recommender systems, and classify a set of appropriate well known evaluation metrics for each task. We demonstrate how using an improper evaluation metric can lead to the selection of an improper algorithm for the task of interest. We also discuss other important considerations when designing offline experiments.},

While conducting this systematic literature review (SLR), we identified 1395 potentially relevant papers, then filtered them through the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and finally selected and analyzed 28 relevant papers. Rating-based relevance is the most popular target metric, while less than a half of papers optimize learning-based metrics. Only a third of the papers used outcome-based assessment to measure the pedagogical effect of recommendations, mostly within a formal university course.

  abstract = {Recommender Systems have become a very useful tool for a large variety of domains. Researchers have been attempting to improve their algorithms in order to issue better predictions to the users. However, one of the current challenges in the area refers to how to properly evaluate the predictions generated by a recommender system. In the extent of offline evaluations, some traditional concepts of evaluation have been explored, such as accuracy, Root Mean Square Error and P@N for top-k recommendations. In recent years, more research have proposed some new concepts such as novelty, diversity and serendipity. These concepts have been addressed with the goal to satisfy the users' requirements. Numerous definitions and metrics have been proposed in previous work. On the absence of a specific summarization on evaluations of recommendation combining traditional metrics and recent progresses, this paper surveys and organizes the main research that present definitions about concepts and propose metrics or strategies to evaluate recommendations. In addition, this survey also settles the relationship between the concepts, categorizes them according to their objectives and suggests potential future topics on user satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Various studies in recent years have pointed out large issues in the offline evaluation of recommender systems, making it difficult to assess whether true progress has been made. However, there has been little research into what set of practices should serve as a starting point during experimentation. In this paper, we examine four larger issues in recommender system research regarding uncertainty estimation, generalization, hyperparameter optimization and dataset pre-processing in more detail to arrive at a set of guidelines. We present a TrainRec, a lightweight and flexible toolkit for offline training and evaluation of recommender systems that implements these guidelines. Different from other frameworks, TrainRec is a toolkit that focuses on experimentation alone, offering flexible modules that can be can be used together or in isolation. Finally, we demonstrate TrainRec's usefulness by evaluating a diverse set of twelve baselines across ten datasets. Our results show that (i) many results on smaller datasets are likely not statistically significant, (ii) there are at least three baselines that perform well on most datasets and should be considered in future experiments, and (iii) improved uncertainty quantification (via nested CV and statistical testing) rules out some reported differences between linear and neural methods. Given these results, we advocate that future research should standardize evaluation using our suggested guidelines.},

  title = {On the Reliability of Sampling Strategies in Offline Recommender Evaluation},
  abstract = {Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation. Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust offline comparisons.},

  abstract = {Recommendation has become a prominent area of research in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). Evaluation is also a traditional research topic in this community. Motivated by a few counter-intuitive observations reported in recent studies, this perspectives paper takes a fresh look at recommender systems from an evaluation standpoint. Rather than examining metrics like recall, hit rate, or NDCG, or perspectives like novelty and diversity, the key focus here is on how these metrics are calculated when evaluating a recommender algorithm. Specifically, the commonly used train/test data splits and their consequences are re-examined. We begin by examining common data splitting methods, such as random split or leave-one-out, and discuss why the popularity baseline is poorly defined under such splits. We then move on to explore the two implications of neglecting a global timeline during evaluation: data leakage and oversimplification of user preference modeling. Afterwards, we present new perspectives on recommender systems, including techniques for evaluating algorithm performance that more accurately reflect real-world scenarios, and possible approaches to consider decision contexts in user preference modeling.},

We discover a surprising degree of systematic disagreement that was occasionally noted but not explained in the literature by previous authors. We find an explanation for the discrepancy be-tween the metrics in the effect of popularity biases, which impact false and true-positive metrics in very different ways: instead of rewarding the recommendation of popular items, as with true-positive, false-positive metrics penalize the popular. We determine precise conditions and cases in the general trends, with a formal explanation for our findings, which we confirm and illustrate empirically in experiments with different datasets.},

Offline methodologies for recommender system evaluation evolved from experimental practice in Machine Learning (ML) and Information Retrieval (IR). However, evaluating recommendations involves particularities that pose challenges to the assumptions upon which the ML and IR methodologies were developed. We recap and reflect on the development and current status of recommender system evaluation, providing an updated perspective. With a focus on offline evaluation, we review the adaptation of IR principles, procedures and metrics, and the implications of those techniques when applied to recommender systems. At the same time, we identify the singularities of recommendation that require different responses, or involve specific new needs. In addition, we provide an overview of important choices in the configuration of experiments that require particular care and understanding; discuss broader perspectives of evaluation such as recommendation value beyond accuracy; and survey open challenges such as experimental biases, and the cyclic dimension of recommendation.},

  title = {Sustainable Transparency in Recommender Systems: Bayesian Ranking of Images for Explainability},
  abstract = {Recommender Systems have become crucial in the modern world, commonly guiding users towards relevant content or products, and having a large influence over the decisions of users and citizens. However, ensuring transparency and user trust in these systems remains a challenge; personalized explanations have emerged as a solution, offering justifications for recommendations. Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using existing visual content created by users is a promising option to maximize transparency and user trust. State-of-the-art models that follow this approach, despite leveraging highly optimized architectures, employ surrogate learning tasks that do not efficiently model the objective of ranking images as explanations for a given recommendation; this leads to a suboptimal training process with high computational costs that may not be reduced without affecting model performance. This work presents BRIE, a novel model where we leverage Bayesian Pairwise Ranking to enhance the training process, allowing us to consistently outperform state-of-the-art models in six real-world datasets while reducing its model size by up to 64 times and its CO\$\_2\$ emissions by up to 75\% in training and inference.},

  title = {Demystifying Recommendations: Transparency and Explainability in Recommendation Systems},
  abstract = {Abstract: Recommendation algorithms are widely used, however many consumers want more clarity on why specific goods are recommended to them. The absence of explainability jeopardizes user trust, satisfaction, and potentially privacy. Improving transparency is difficult and involves the need for flexible interfaces, privacy protection, scalability, and customisation. Explainable recommendations provide substantial advantages such as enhancing relevance assessment, bolstering user interactions, facilitating system monitoring, and fostering accountability. Typical methods include giving summaries of the fundamental approach, emphasizing significant data points, and utilizing hybrid recommendation models. Case studies demonstrate that openness has assisted platforms such as YouTube and Spotify in achieving more than a 10\% increase in key metrics like click-through rate. Additional research should broaden the methods for providing explanations, increase real-world implementation in other industries, guarantee human-centered supervision of suggestions, and promote consumer trust by following ethical standards. Accurate recommendations are essential. The future involves developing technologies that provide users with information while honoring their autonomy.},

  title = {Interactive Explanation with Varying Level of Details in an Explainable Scientific Literature Recommender System},
  abstract = {AbstractExplainable recommender systems (RS) have traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all approach, delivering the same explanation level of detail to each user, without considering their individual needs and goals. Further, explanations in RS have so far been presented mostly in a static and non-interactive manner. To fill these research gaps, we aim in this paper to adopt a user-centered, interactive explanation model that provides explanations with different levels of detail and empowers users to interact with, control, and personalize the explanations based on their needs and preferences. We followed a user-centered approach to design interactive explanations with three levels of detail (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and implemented them in the transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA). We conducted a qualitative user study (N = 14) to investigate the impact of providing interactive explanations with varying level of details on the users' perception of the explainable RS. Our study showed qualitative evidence that fostering interaction and giving users control in deciding which explanation they would like to see can meet the demands of users with different needs, preferences, and goals, and consequently can have positive effects on different crucial aspects in explainable recommendation, including transparency, trust, satisfaction, and user experience.Keywords: Recommender systemintelligent user interfacesexplainable recommendationinteractive explanationintelligibility typesvisualization Authors contributionsConceptualization, M.G., M.A.C. and T.V.; Methodology, M.G. and M.A.C.; Validation, M.A.C.; Software, T.V. and S.J.; Writing–original draft preparation, M.G. and T.V.; Writing–review and editing, M.G. and M.A.C.; Visualization, M.G., T.V., S.J., Q.U.A, R.A. and C.S.; Supervision, M.A.C.

  title = {Accurate and justifiable : new algorithms for explainable recommendations.},
  abstract = {Websites and online services thrive with large amounts of online information, products, and choices, that are available but exceedingly difficult to find and discover. This has prompted two major paradigms to help sift through information: information retrieval and recommender systems. The broad family of information retrieval techniques has given rise to the modern search engines which return relevant results, following a user's explicit query. The broad family of recommender systems, on the other hand, works in a more subtle manner, and do not require an explicit query to provide relevant results. Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems are based on algorithms that provide suggestions to users, based on what they like and what other similar users like. Their strength lies in their ability to make serendipitous, social recommendations about what books to read, songs to listen to, movies to watch, courses to take, or generally any type of item to consume. Their strength is also that they can recommend items of any type or content because their focus is on modeling the preferences of the users rather than the content of the recommended items. Although recommender systems have made great strides over the last two decades, with significant algorithmic advances that have made them increasingly accurate in their predictions, they suffer from a few notorious weaknesses. These include the cold-start problem when new items or new users enter the system, and lack of interpretability and explainability in the case of powerful black-box predictors, such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) family of recommenders, including, in particular, the popular Matrix Factorization (MF) techniques. Also, the absence of any explanations to justify their predictions can reduce the transparency of recommender systems and thus adversely impact the user's trust in them. In this work, we propose machine learning approaches for multi-domain Matrix Factorization (MF) recommender systems that can overcome the new user cold-start problem. We also propose new algorithms to generate explainable recommendations, using two state of the art models: Matrix Factorization (MF) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Our experiments, which were based on rigorous cross-validation on the MovieLens benchmark data set and on real user tests, confirmed that our proposed methods succeed in generating explainable recommendations without a major sacrifice in accuracy.},

  title = {The effects of transparency on trust in and acceptance of a content-based art recommender},
  abstract = {The increasing availability of (digital) cultural heritage artefacts offers great potential for increased access to art content, but also necessitates tools to help users deal with such abundance of information. User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (N = 60) evaluated interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users with artworks that are of interest to them, based on their ratings of other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent, version 2 explained to the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations. Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency. Showing how certain the system was of a recommendation did not influence trust and acceptance. A number of guidelines for design of recommender systems in the cultural heritage domain have been derived from the study's results.},

  title = {Explainable Recommendation: A Survey and New Perspectives},
  abstract = {Explainable recommendation attempts to develop models that generate not only high-quality recommendations but also intuitive explanations. The explanations may either be post-hoc or directly come from an explainable model (also called interpretable or transparent model in some contexts). Explainable recommendation tries to address the problem of why: by providing explanations to users or system designers, it helps humans to understand why certain items are recommended by the algorithm, where the human can either be users or system designers. Explainable recommendation helpsendation systems. It also facilitates system design to improve the transparency, persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of recommers for better system debugging. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches – especially model-based methods – have been proposed and applied in real-world systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review for the explainable recommendation research. We first highlight the position of explainable recommendation in recommender system research by categorizing recommendation problems into the 5W, i.e., what, when, who, where, and why. We then conduct a comprehensive survey of explainable recommendation on three perspectives: 1) We provide a chronological research timeline of explainable recommendation, including user study approaches in the early years and more recent model-based approaches. 2) We provide a two-dimensional taxonomy to classify existing explainable recommendation research: one dimension is the information source (or display style) of the explanations, and the other dimension is the algorithmic mechanism to generate explainable recommendations. 3) We summarize how explainable recommendation applies to different recommendation tasks, such as product recommendation, social recommendation, and POI recommendation. We also devote a section to discuss the explanation perspectives in broader IR and AI/ML research. We end the survey by discussing potential future directions to promote the explainable recommendation research area and beyond.},

  abstract = {In the digital era, recommender systems (RS) have become an integral part of our daily interactions, exerting a significant impact on users and society. However, this also raises ethical challenges related to RS that should be considered. Addressing these challenges requires the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models to make RS more understandable. Based on the current state-of-the-art literature, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of XAI for RS and its ethical implications, with the aim of proposing a research agenda for ethical RS based on XAI. The findings of the literature review show that neural network-based RS have received much attention in terms of offering explanations, while there is a research gap in explaining context-based RS and in evaluating explanations. In addition, a set of ethical challenges for RS are discussed by exploring how explanations for recommendations can contribute to the ethical use of RS.},

These methods help to communicate how the model works with the aim of making ML models more transparent and increasing the trust of end-users into their output. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation (LIME) are two widely used XAI methods, particularly with tabular data. In this perspective piece, we discuss the way the explainability metrics of these two methods are generated and propose a framework for interpretation of their outputs, highlighting their weaknesses and strengths. Specifically, we discuss their outcomes in terms of model-dependency and in the presence of collinearity among the features, relying on a case study from the biomedical domain (classification of individuals with or without myocardial infarction). The results indicate that SHAP and LIME are highly affected by the adopted ML model and feature collinearity, raising a note of caution on their usage and interpretation.},

Our search yielded 232 articles, but after applying inclusion criteria, only six were identified as directly addressing the use of LLMs in explaining recommendations. This scarcity highlights that, despite the rise of LLMs, their application in explainable recommender systems is still in an early stage. We analyze these select studies to understand current methodologies, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs improving explanations of recommender systems and encourage the development of more transparent and user-centric recommendation explanation solutions.},

  title = {From Model Explanation to Data Misinterpretation: Uncovering the
  Pitfalls of Post Hoc Explainers in Business Research},
  abstract = {Machine learning models have been increasingly used in business research. However, most state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as deep neural networks and XGBoost, are black boxes in nature. Therefore, post hoc explainers that provide explanations for machine learning models by, for example, estimating numerical importance of the input features, have been gaining wide usage. Despite the intended use of post hoc explainers being explaining machine learning models, we found a growing trend in business research where post hoc explanations are used to draw inferences about the data. In this work, we investigate the validity of such use. Specifically, we investigate with extensive experiments whether the explanations obtained by the two most popular post hoc explainers, SHAP and LIME, provide correct information about the true marginal effects of X on Y in the data, which we call data-alignment. We then identify what factors influence the alignment of explanations. Finally, we propose a set of mitigation strategies to improve the data-alignment of explanations and demonstrate their effectiveness with real-world data in an econometric context. In spite of this effort, we nevertheless conclude that it is often not appropriate to infer data insights from post hoc explanations. We articulate appropriate alternative uses, the most important of which is to facilitate the proposition and subsequent empirical investigation of hypotheses. The ultimate goal of this paper is to caution business researchers against translating post hoc explanations of machine learning models into potentially false insights and understanding of data.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the defense sector, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been used to analyse and decipher massive volumes of data, namely for target recognition, surveillance, threat detection and cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles and drones guidance, and language translation. However, there are key points that have been identified as barriers or challenges, especially related to data curation. For this reason, and also due to the need for quick response, the defense sector is looking for AI technologies capable of successfully processing and extracting results from huge amounts of unlabelled or very poorly labelled data. This paper presents an in-depth review of AI/ML algorithms for unsupervised or poorly supervised data, and machine learning operations (MLOps) techniques that are suitable for the defense industry. The algorithms are divided according to their nature, meaning that they either focus on techniques, or on applications. Techniques can belong to the supervision spectrum, or focus on explainability. Applications are either focused on text processing or computer vision. MLOps techniques, tools and practices are then discussed, revealing approaches and reporting experiences with the objective of declaring how to make the operationalization of ML integrated systems more efficient. Despite many contributions from several researchers and industry, further efforts are required to construct substantially robust and reliable models and supporting infrastructures for AI systems, which are reliable and suitable for the defense sector. This review brings up-to-date information regarding AI algorithms and MLOps that will be helpful for future research in the field.},

  title = {Disagreement amongst counterfactual explanations: how transparency can be misleading},
  abstract = {Abstract Counterfactual explanations are increasingly used as an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to provide stakeholders of complex machine learning algorithms with explanations for data-driven decisions. The popularity of counterfactual explanations resulted in a boom in the algorithms generating them. However, not every algorithm creates uniform explanations for the same instance. Even though in some contexts multiple possible explanations are beneficial, there are circumstances where diversity amongst counterfactual explanations results in a potential disagreement problem among stakeholders. Ethical issues arise when for example, malicious agents use this diversity to fairwash an unfair machine learning model by hiding sensitive features. As legislators worldwide tend to start including the right to explanations for data-driven, high-stakes decisions in their policies, these ethical issues should be understood and addressed. Our literature review on the disagreement problem in XAI reveals that this problem has never been empirically assessed for counterfactual explanations. Therefore, in this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis, on 40 data sets, using 12 explanation-generating methods, for two black-box models, yielding over 192,000 explanations. Our study finds alarmingly high disagreement levels between the methods tested. A malicious user is able to both exclude and include desired features when multiple counterfactual explanations are available. This disagreement seems to be driven mainly by the data set characteristics and the type of counterfactual algorithm. XAI centers on the transparency of algorithmic decision-making, but our analysis advocates for transparency about this self-proclaimed transparency.},

  title = {A hybrid explainability framework for recommender systems using SHAP with natural language interpretations},
  abstract = {Recommender systems based on deep neural networks are widely recognized for their high predictive accuracy, but their opaque nature limits transparency and interpretability, crucial qualities needed to ensure accountability, fairness, and trust, especially as the right to explanation is increasingly regarded as a legal and ethical obligation in high-stakes decision-making. This study presents a hybrid explainability framework for recommender systems that combines SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) with natural language justifications to enhance the explainability of recommender system outputs. The framework integrates both local and global SHAP-based explanations. Local explanations analyze instance-level Shapley values to identify features that positively influence individual recommendations, while global Shapley values, computed at the item level, capture the dominant features characterizing the recommended item, which are then translated into item-level textual descriptions. These two explanation layers are then used to generate coherent, human-readable justifications for recommended items using large language models. The approach is implemented in a career recommendation engine based on aptitude profiles from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). Expert evaluations on a five-point Likert scale yielded mean scores between 3.7 and 4.4 across various user profiles, indicating moderately high acceptance of the explanations generated by the framework. The findings suggest that the framework enhances transparency, fairness, accountability, and user trust in the recommendation process.},

  abstract = {Adding explanations to recommender systems is said to have multiple benefits, such as increasing user trust or system transparency. Previous work from other application areas suggests that specific user characteristics impact the users’ perception of the explanation. However, we rarely find this type of evaluation for recommender systems explanations. This paper addresses this gap by surveying 124 papers in which recommender systems explanations were evaluated in user studies. We analyzed their participant descriptions and study results where the impact of user characteristics on the explanation effects was measured. Our findings suggest that the results from the surveyed studies predominantly cover specific users who do not necessarily represent the users of recommender systems in the evaluation domain. This may seriously hamper the generalizability of any insights we may gain from current studies on explanations in recommender systems. We further find inconsistencies in the data reporting, which impacts the reproducibility of the reported results. Hence, we recommend actions to move toward a more inclusive and reproducible evaluation.},

  title = {XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation},
  abstract = {Recommender systems help users navigate information overload by providing personalized recommendations aligned with their preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users' understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework empowers LLMs to understand complex patterns in user-item interactions and gain a deeper understanding of user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of XRec, showcasing its ability to generate comprehensive and meaningful explanations that outperform baseline approaches in explainable recommender systems. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/XRec.},

  title = {Reproducibility Study of "XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation"},
  abstract = {In this study, we reproduced the work done in the paper "XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation" by Ma et al. (2024). The original authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike.

  title = {Explainable AI (XAI): A Systematic Meta-Survey of Current Challenges and Future Opportunities},
  abstract = {The past decade has seen significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI), which has resulted in algorithms being adopted for resolving a variety of problems. However, this success has been met by increasing model complexity and employing black-box AI models that lack transparency. In response to this need, Explainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to make AI more transparent and thus advance the adoption of AI in critical domains. Although there are several reviews of XAI topics in the literature that identified challenges and potential research directions in XAI, these challenges and research directions are scattered. This study, hence, presents a systematic meta-survey for challenges and future research directions in XAI organized in two themes: (1) general challenges and research directions in XAI and (2) challenges and research directions in XAI based on machine learning life cycle's phases: design, development, and deployment. We believe that our meta-survey contributes to XAI literature by providing a guide for future exploration in the XAI area.},

  title = {Filter bubbles in recommender systems: Fact or fallacy—A systematic review},
  abstract = {Abstract A filter bubble refers to the phenomenon where Internet customization effectively isolates individuals from diverse opinions or materials, resulting in their exposure to only a select set of content. This can lead to the reinforcement of existing attitudes, beliefs, or conditions. In this study, our primary focus is to investigate the impact of filter bubbles in recommender systems (RSs). This pioneering research aims to uncover the reasons behind this problem, explore potential solutions, and propose an integrated tool to help users avoid filter bubbles in RSs. To achieve this objective, we conduct a systematic literature review on the topic of filter bubbles in RSs. The reviewed articles are carefully analyzed and classified, providing valuable insights that inform the development of an integrated approach. Notably, our review reveals evidence of filter bubbles in RSs, highlighting several biases that contribute to their existence. Moreover, we propose mechanisms to mitigate the impact of filter bubbles and demonstrate that incorporating diversity into recommendations can potentially help alleviate this issue. The findings of this timely review will serve as a benchmark for researchers working in interdisciplinary fields such as privacy, artificial intelligence ethics, and RSs. Furthermore, it will open new avenues for future research in related domains, prompting further exploration and advancement in this critical area.

  title = {Justification vs. Transparency: Why and How Visual Explanations in a Scientific Literature Recommender System},
  abstract = {Significant attention has been paid to enhancing recommender systems (RS) with explanation facilities to help users make informed decisions and increase trust in and satisfaction with the RS. Justification and transparency represent two crucial goals in explainable recommendation. Different from transparency, which faithfully exposes the reasoning behind the recommendation mechanism, justification conveys a conceptual model that may differ from that of the underlying algorithm. An explanation is an answer to a question. In explainable recommendation, a user would want to ask questions (referred to as intelligibility types) to understand results given by the RS. In this paper, we identify relationships between Why and How explanation intelligibility types and the explanation goals of justification and transparency. We followed the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach and leveraged the What-Why-How visualization framework to systematically design and implement Why and How visual explanations in the transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA). Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative user study (N=12) to investigate the potential effects of providing Why and How explanations together in an explainable RS on the users' perceptions regarding transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Our study showed qualitative evidence confirming that the choice of the explanation intelligibility types depends on the explanation goal and user type.},

  title = {Recommendation Systems on E-Learning and Social Learning: A Systematic Review},
  abstract = {E-learning is renowned as one of the highly effective modalities of learning. Social learning, in turn, is considered to be of major importance as it promotes collaboration between learners. For properly managing learning resources, recommender systems have been implemented in e-learning to enhance learners' experience. Whilst recommender systems are of widespread concern in online learning, it is still unclear to educators how recommender systems can improve the learning process and have a positive impact on learning. This paper seeks to provide an overview of the recommender systems proposed in e-learning between 2007 and the first part of 2021. Out of 100 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and the first part of 2021, 51 articles were included for final synthesis, according to specific criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in educational recommender systems papers have approached e-learning in a general way without putting as much emphasis on social learning, and that recommender systems based on explicit feedbacks and ratings were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents several recommender systems types in e-learning: (1) Content-based recommender systems, (2) Collaborative-filtering recommender systems, (3) Hybrid recommender systems and (4) Recommender systems based on supervised and unsupervised algorithms. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection on the importance of addressing recommender systems in social learning and social educational networks in particular, especially as social learning has particular requirements, the weak databases size used in some research work, the importance of acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of each type of recommender system in an educational context and the need for further exploration of implicit feedbacks more than explicit learners’ feedbacks for more accurate recommendations.},

  abstract = {The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\textbackslash{}\%, corresponding to 82.85\textbackslash{}\% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.},

They understand their preferences and support them in discovering meaningful content by creating personalized recommendations. With governmental regulations and growing users’ privacy awareness, capturing the required data is a challenging task today. Federated learning is a novel approach for distributed machine learning, which keeps users’ privacy in mind.

  title = {Towards Fairness in Provably Communication-Efficient Federated
  Recommender Systems},
  abstract = {To reduce the communication overhead caused by parallel training of multiple clients, various federated learning (FL) techniques use random client sampling. Nonetheless, ensuring the efficacy of random sampling and determining the optimal number of clients to sample in federated recommender systems (FRSs) remains challenging due to the isolated nature of each user as a separate client. This challenge is exacerbated in models where public and private features can be separated, and FL allows communication of only public features (item gradients). In this study, we establish sample complexity bounds that dictate the ideal number of clients required for improved communication efficiency and retained accuracy in such models. In line with our theoretical findings, we empirically demonstrate that RS-FairFRS reduces communication cost (\textasciitilde{}47\%). Second, we demonstrate the presence of class imbalance among clients that raises a substantial equity concern for FRSs. Unlike centralized machine learning, clients in FRS can not share raw data, including sensitive attributes. For this, we introduce RS-FairFRS, first fairness under unawareness FRS built upon random sampling based FRS. While random sampling improves communication efficiency, we propose a novel two-phase dual-fair update technique to achieve fairness without revealing protected attributes of active clients participating in training. Our results on real-world datasets and different sensitive features illustrate a significant reduction in demographic bias (\textasciitilde{}approx40\textbackslash{}\%), offering a promising path to achieving fairness and communication efficiency in FRSs without compromising the overall accuracy of FRS.},

  abstract = {The large-scale application of artificial intelligence to personalization has become a digital infrastructure that is required, which is fundamentally changing the way individuals access information, services, and opportunities. Democracy in access may be enabled by such systems, but in society, there is a fundamental conflict between maximizing engagement and achievement. The current personalization systems are characterized by prioritizing instant interactions to the detriment of diversity in information and equal accessibility, resulting in the mentioned disparities between demographic groups, which are reported. This article suggests that distributed systems, the technical basis that makes large-scale personalization possible, could be re-architectured to include ethical concerns not as a feature but as a central element of the architecture. Through exploring the duality of AI personalization, creating an ethical system around distributed architectures, exploring regulatory needs, and demonstrating responsible systems, a direction can be seen towards personalization systems that are both optimizing and ethical in nature. These architectures combine fairness checks, cultural diversity, governance structures, and multi-objective optimization to build personalization infrastructures that broaden, not reduce, human capabilities and social cohesion.},

  title = {Towards Fair Federated Recommendation Learning: Characterizing the Inter-Dependence of System and Data Heterogeneity},
  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an effective mechanism for data privacy in recommender systems that runs machine learning model training on-device. While prior FL optimizations tackled the data and system heterogeneity challenges, they assume the two are independent of each other. This fundamental assumption is not reflective of real-world, large-scale recommender systems — data and system heterogeneity are tightly intertwined. This paper takes a data-driven approach to show the inter-dependence of data and system heterogeneity in real-world data and quantifies its impact on the overall model quality and fairness. We design a framework, RF2, to model the inter-dependence and evaluate its impact on state-of-the-art model optimization techniques for federated recommendation tasks. We demonstrate that the impact on fairness can be severe under realistic heterogeneity scenarios, by up to 15.8–41 × compared to a simple setup assumed in most (if not all) prior work. The result shows that modeling realistic system-induced data heterogeneity is essential to achieving fair federated recommendation learning.},

  title = {State-of-the-Art Survey on Deep Learning-Based Recommender Systems for E-Learning},
  abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) are increasingly recognized as intelligent software for predicting users’ opinions on specific items. Various RSs have been developed in different domains, such as e-commerce, e-government, e-resource services, e-business, e-library, e-tourism, and e-learning, to make excellent user recommendations. In e-learning technology, RSs are designed to support and improve the learning practices of a student or an organization. This survey aims to examine the different works of literature on RSs that corroborate e-learning and classify and provide statistics of the reviewed articles based on their recommendation goals, recommendation techniques used, the target user, and the application platforms. The survey makes a prominent contribution to the e-learning RSs field by providing an overview of current research and traditional and nontraditional recommendation techniques to provide different recommendations for future e-learning. One of the most significant findings to emerge from this survey is that a substantial number of works followed either deep learning or context-aware recommendation techniques, which are considered more efficient than any traditional methods. Finally, we provided comprehensive observations from the quantitative assessment of publications, which can guide and support researchers in understanding the current development for potential future trends and the direction of deep learning-based RSs in e-learning.},

  title = {Navigating the Future of Federated Recommendation Systems with Foundation Models},
  abstract = {Federated Recommendation Systems (FRSs) offer a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional centralized approaches by decentralizing data storage. However, they face persistent challenges such as data sparsity and heterogeneity, largely due to isolated client environments. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs), particularly large language models like ChatGPT, present an opportunity to surmount these issues through powerful, cross-task knowledge transfer. In this position paper, we systematically examine the convergence of FRSs and FMs, illustrating how FM-enhanced frameworks can substantially improve client-side personalization, communication efficiency, and server-side aggregation. We also delve into pivotal challenges introduced by this integration, including privacy-security trade-offs, non-IID data, and resource constraints in federated setups, and propose prospective research directions in areas such as multimodal recommendation, real-time FM adaptation, and explainable federated reasoning. By unifying FRSs with FMs, our position paper provides a forward-looking roadmap for advancing privacy-preserving, high-performance recommendation systems that fully leverage large-scale pre-trained knowledge to enhance local performance.},
